### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hi, cleverwolfano here!
#### Waiting for opportunities...
Î“ÎµÎ¹Î± ÏƒÎ±Ï‚! How's it going? I'm cleverwolfano. I'm starting my programming and robotics journey. I'm currently learning python, expanding my Luau knowledge and working hard on modelling software. While of course completing, and even surpassing my academic requirements. I'm also a Discord moderator working daily to ensure member satisfaction, currently handled over 1500 cases! 

*Also looking for opportunities to learn! If you have any, please shoot me a DM.*

I'm also an international resident, having relocated over 5 times over 3 different continents. I speak 3 languages fluently while working hard to expand others. Feel free to contact me in any other the languages I speak. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸


**Working on:** 

Lua / Python / Disnake
Autodesk Fusion 360 / Blender

- ðŸ”­ I'm always expanding this page!
